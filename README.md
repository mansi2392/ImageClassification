# Image Classification using CNN
Supervised Image classification with ResNet

#### Image data visualization in Python and ResNet Image classificaiton
Here is the notebook that demonstrated initializing and training ResNet-18 NN using pytorch and CIFAR-10 dataset
https://github.com/mansi2392/ImageClassification/blob/master/ResNetImageClassification.ipynb

Image data is visualized in form of feature maps created after every stage in a CNN.
